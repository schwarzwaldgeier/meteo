To Do list

- get better climate data from NOAA

- improve labeling - time should round to nearest month/week/etc

- Actually implement monthly plots

- documentation

- build tarball to install modules in usual places

- Roses need *lots* of work. They need to be normalized, they need axes, more
options, ...

- color background on wind plot by temperature? or color compass direction,
blue for a north wind, red for a south wind.
