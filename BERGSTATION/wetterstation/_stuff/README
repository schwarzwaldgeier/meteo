Weather Tools

Not very well organized, but pretty modular. Read Weather_tools
for the roadmap. Someday I may create a real Makefile.pl setup
so it will install easily.

Basically, put the modules in your perl library structure, and put
the other scripts in your bin directory.

I have also included 2 files of test data, just to be minimally helpful.

You will need the following perl modules installed, some of which have other
dependencies. GD::Graph, in particular can be a challenge to install. Good
luck! :

GD::Graph
Date::Calc
Getopt::Declare
Device::SerialPort
Class::MethodMaker
Time::Local
